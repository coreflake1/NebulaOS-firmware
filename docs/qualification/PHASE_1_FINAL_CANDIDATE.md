# Phase 1 Final Candidate — Frozen for Hardware Qualification

Produced by the Phase 1 overnight closure mission and finalized by the
Phase 1 final candidate cleanup mission. This document records the exact,
frozen identity of the candidate that tomorrow's hardware sessions must
test. **Nothing in this document may be silently changed** — if a real
architectural contradiction is found tomorrow requiring a source change, a
new candidate must be built and this document (or a successor) updated
explicitly, in its own reviewed commit.

## Status

```
SOURCE_VERIFIED=YES
BUILD_VERIFIED=YES
HARDWARE_QUALIFIED=NO
PHASE_1_OFFLINE_WORK_COMPLETE=YES
FINAL_CANDIDATE_FROZEN=YES
PHASE_1_PRINTER_COMPLETE=NO  (requires tomorrow's real hardware qualification)
```

## Branches (both pushed)

| Repo | Branch | Tip commit |
|---|---|---|
| NebulaOS-firmware | `phase1.9b/plr` | `db6870b` |
| NebulaOS-klipper-extensions | `phase1.9b/plr` | `b6ae35e` |

Neither branch has been merged to `main`. Per this mission's own hard
rule, nothing here is promoted or labeled hardware-qualified — that
requires tomorrow's real tests to pass first.

None of these pins besides `KLIPPER_EXTENSIONS_PIN` were touched by either
the overnight closure or final-candidate-cleanup missions.

## Build artifact hashes

From this exact candidate's own genuinely clean build (empty `vendor/`,
fresh network fetch, `built_at=2026-08-30T11:57:07Z`):

```
built_at=2026-08-30T11:57:07Z

buildroot_config_sha256=fe95305b3643077e80f0396d00142c27f362de20a7b6b8f2b028047fd00c40b8

```

`device_tree_sha256`/`kernel_config_sha256`/`buildroot_config_sha256` are
identical to every other build this session produced from this same
source (proving the kernel/DTS/Kconfig *content* is stable and
reproducible). `xImage_sha256` and `guppyscreen_sha256` differ from
build to build **despite identical pinned source** in every build run
this session (three different GuppyScreen hashes, two different xImage
hashes, across three separate builds, all from the same
`git_commit_guppyscreen`/kernel pins) - this is expected, build-
environment-dependent nondeterminism (most likely an embedded build
timestamp in each binary's own version-reporting/banner), not a real
source or behavioral change. `GD32_CHANGED`/`GUPPYSCREEN_CHANGED` are
therefore verified by **source pin identity**
(`git_commit_guppyscreen=5f1911ac938451bb00439e8c55c87ef60b4a1566`,
unchanged - confirmed unmodified by this mission), not by binary hash
matching, which is not a meaningful comparison for either artifact given
this nondeterminism.

## What changed to reach this candidate

- **Overnight closure mission (Missions A–L)**: checkpoint execution
  semantics fixed (candidate/promotion pipeline gated on real motion
  completion via `mcu.estimated_print_time()`), physical-recovery analysis
  (`SAFE_AUTOMATIC_POSITION_RECOVERY=NO`, honestly concluded), the formal
  `PLR_SUPPORTED_CONTRACT`, an adversarial storage-transaction review (no
  new gap), an EEPROM endurance calculation (no concern), the
  `candidate-post-build` SOURCE/BUILD/HARDWARE-QUALIFIED distinction, the
  hardware qualification harness, and the regression matrix. Full detail:
  [`_project/missions/phase1-overnight-closure-final-report.md`](../../_project/missions/phase1-overnight-closure-final-report.md).
- **Final candidate cleanup mission**: fixed the one remaining
  `06-verify.sh` MISS (`[nebulaos_version]` — a stale check that grepped
  `printer.cfg`'s own text instead of following its `[include
  platform.cfg]`, where the section actually lives and always has). Fixed
  the one remaining pre-existing test failure (`test_nebulaos_compat`'s
  manifest-completeness check — `test_z_offset_probe_down_min_z.py`
  existed but was never declared in `nebulaos-extensions.json`, a
  trivial, zero-behavior-change manifest fix). Also found and fixed a
  genuine, previously-mischaracterized bug: `vendor/v4l-utils` appearing
  dirty was never reused-checkout staleness — it's a deterministic side
  effect of `04-cross-compile-app-stack.sh`'s own `autoreconf`/`autopoint`
  workaround for that vendor's build, present on every build including a
  genuinely fresh one, and `06-verify.sh`'s allowlist had simply never
  been updated for it.

## Build verification

```
sh scripts/build/assert-baseline-config.sh pre-build            # SOURCE_VERIFIED
sh scripts/build/assert-baseline-config.sh candidate-post-build # BUILD_VERIFIED
sh scripts/build/06-verify.sh                                    # rootfs/DTB/config content
```

All three were run against this exact candidate's own genuinely clean
build (fresh `vendor/`, no reused state, canonical `build.sh` /
pinned container). Result: **215 OK / 0 MISS** from `06-verify.sh`,
`BUILD_VERIFIED` from `candidate-post-build`, zero failures across the
full 398-test offline suite (336 Python `unittest` + 62 shell-test-suite
assertions across `host-mcu-tests.sh`/`recovery-safety-tests.sh`/
`plr-tombstone-tests.sh`/`candidate-vs-qualified-baseline-tests.sh`). See
the Phase 1 final candidate cleanup report for the exact per-suite
accounting.

`VENDOR_DRIFT=0` — every pinned component (kernel, buildroot, klipper,
moonraker, k1-ustreamer, v4l-utils, guppyscreen, pellcorp-creality)
verified clean, from a genuinely fresh, network-only fetch, no allowlist
gaps remaining.

## Explicit non-promotions

- `manifests/dependencies.conf`'s `QUALIFIED_BASELINE_TAG` is **unchanged**
  — still `nebulaos-canonical-baseline-2026-08-14-prtouch-qualified`.
  Promoting it to a new tag covering this candidate is a separate,
  deliberate action to take only after tomorrow's hardware qualification
  passes.
- Neither branch is merged to `main`.
- Nothing in this candidate is described anywhere as "hardware-qualified".

**Tomorrow, qualify only these exact artifacts. Do not rebuild before
hardware testing.**
