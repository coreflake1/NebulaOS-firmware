# The one documented command to reproduce the current qualified NebulaOS
# baseline from a fresh clone:
#
#   git clone https://github.com/coreflake1/NebulaOS-firmware.git
#   cd NebulaOS-firmware
#   ./build.sh
#
# Fetches every pinned dependency (kernel, Klipper, GuppyScreen, Moonraker,
# Buildroot, ustreamer, Mainsail, wireless-regdb, WiFi firmware - see
# manifests/dependencies.conf), composes all 8 accepted baseline variants,
# builds the kernel/rootfs/app-stack, and verifies the result against the
# accepted-baseline assertions - scripts/build/build-qualified-baseline.sh
# does the actual sequencing; this is a thin, host-dependency-aware wrapper
# around it, not a reimplementation.
#
# Phase 11 (2026-08-15, unified-build-environment migration): this used to
# have two modes - run directly on a host with git/curl/etc already
# installed, or `--containerized` to get those from a thin wrapper image
# that then launched TWO MORE nested containers (pellcorp/k1-bash-build,
# ghcr.io/coreflake1/guppydev) via the host's own Docker socket for the
# actual work. That nested-container design is gone. There is now exactly
# ONE container, pinned by digest in manifests/dependencies.conf
# (BUILD_IMAGE_REPO/BUILD_IMAGE_DIGEST) - it already contains every host
# build tool the 00-06 pipeline needs (see build-env/Dockerfile), so
# nothing here or inside those stages ever calls `docker`/`apt-get` again.
#
# Requires on the host: Docker or Podman, and nothing else - not even git,
# since the container itself is what clones/builds everything once it's
# running with this checkout mounted in.
#
# Does NOT reuse any existing vendor/, build-work/, or artifacts/ state by
# itself - run this against a genuinely fresh clone for a real clean-room
# result (an already-populated vendor/ is convenient for iteration but
# defeats the point of using this script to prove reproducibility).
#
# Exits non-zero if any pin fails to resolve, any variant fails to apply,
# either baseline assertion fails, or any build stage fails - this script
# propagates the container's real exit status, it does not swallow it.

#
#   dev      (default)  ./build.sh            - reuse what is provably safe to
#                       reuse so that edit -> rebuild -> test is not a
#                       from-scratch build every time
#   release  ./build.sh --release             - fresh output, ccache OFF,
#                       exact pins. What a candidate/qualification build runs.
#
# RELEASE IS STICKY AND CANNOT BE DOWNGRADED. It is entered by --release, by
# NEBULAOS_RELEASE_BUILD=1, or by NEBULAOS_CANDIDATE_BUILD=1 - the last of
# these is what the privileged build launcher already sets, so every existing
# candidate build becomes release-grade without the launcher asking for it.
# That direction is the important one: a forgotten flag must never turn a
# qualification build into an accelerated one.

# NEBULAOS_REPO_ROOT: fixed container-internal mount point, deliberately
# NOT the host's own checkout path.
#
# Final Closure mission, Phase C (2026-08-15): this used to mount the
# checkout at the SAME absolute path inside the container as outside it
# (-v "$SCRIPT_DIR:$SCRIPT_DIR"), reasoned at the time as avoiding a path
# boundary crossing. That reasoning missed a real consequence, found by
# the Phase 9 vs Phase 11 artifact comparison: the host's own checkout
# path (which varies - different developers, different clone locations,
# even the same developer's own repeated test directories in this
# session) leaks straight into the build. CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR
# embedded it directly; GuppyScreen's binary carried ~770KB of diff
# traced to embedded absolute build-path strings, purely because the
# container saw a different host path on every separate clone. Two
# builds of byte-identical source, in the byte-identical image, produced
# different output for a reason that has nothing to do with the product.
#
# Mounting at one fixed internal path instead - regardless of where the
# user actually cloned this repo on the host - means every build sees the
# identical internal path, so anything that embeds it (Kconfig strings,
# __FILE__/assert() macros, debug info) embeds the same bytes every time.
# Every script under scripts/build/ already derives its own location via
# `SCRIPT_DIR=$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)` rather than a hardcoded
# path, so this needs no changes anywhere else - they'll all resolve to
# NEBULAOS_REPO_ROOT automatically once the working directory is set here.
# Output files stay on the host exactly as before: a bind mount is a
# transparent, two-way passthrough regardless of which internal path it's
# mounted at, so anything the container writes under NEBULAOS_REPO_ROOT
# still lands at $SCRIPT_DIR on the host.

# other in-container script that shells out to `git` against the checkout)

# is a git WORKTREE rather than a normal clone. A worktree's own .git is a
# FILE containing "gitdir: <host-absolute-path>/.git/worktrees/<name>" -
# that path is real on the host but does not exist inside the container,
# so any git command that walks up from $NEBULAOS_REPO_ROOT to resolve it
# fails outright, aborting the whole build under `set -e`.
#
# Fix: if that's a worktree, bind-mount the real git-common-dir it points
# at, AT THE SAME HOST-ABSOLUTE PATH, read-only, so the pointer resolves
# inside the container exactly like it does on the host. This is the one
# deliberate exception to the "container never sees a host path" rule
# above (Final Closure mission, Phase C) - that rule exists because a host
# path embedded in $NEBULAOS_REPO_ROOT can leak into compiled artifacts
# (Kconfig strings, debug info); a read-only mount used only for `git`
# metadata queries never touches compiled output, so it does not
# reintroduce that problem. A normal clone (.git is a real directory) needs
