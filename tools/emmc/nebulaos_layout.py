"""The Ender-3 V3 KE eMMC layout, with per-fact provenance.

WHERE THESE NUMBERS COME FROM

The vendor's own Ingenic Cloner profile, inside the official recovery package:

    configs/x2000/x2000e_mmc0_lpddr2_linux.cfg
    in Ender-3_V3_KE_1.1.0.12.ingenic
    (pinned by content in manifests/dependencies.conf)

Its [policy0..policy9] sections name every partition and its absolute byte
offset outright:

    uboot   0x0        ota     0x100000   sn_mac  0x200000
    rtos    0x300000   rtos2   0x700000   kernel  0xb00000
    kernel2 0x1300000  rootfs  0x1b00000  rootfs2 0x20f00000

That is a stronger source than anything this project had before, and it
corroborates an independent one. The two slot capacities derived from those
offsets equal, exactly, the constants scripts/flash-spare-slot.sh has enforced
against real hardware since long before this module existed:

    0x1300000 - 0xb00000  = 8388608     == KERNEL_PART_BYTES
    0x20f00000 - 0x1b00000 = 524288000  == ROOTFS_PART_BYTES

Two unrelated sources agreeing to the byte is what makes these VERIFIED rather
than merely plausible. assert_agrees_with_flash_script() below re-derives that
agreement from the shell script's own text, so the two copies cannot drift apart
silently.

WHAT IS STILL NOT KNOWN

The eMMC's total capacity, and therefore the size of userdata; the exact size of
rootfs_data (the docs say "300 MB", which is prose); every partition type GUID;
and which of the ten recorded PARTUUIDs belongs to which partition. None of that
is needed to write slot 2, which is the only thing this project writes.

sn_mac IS THE ONE THAT CANNOT BE UNDONE

/dev/mmcblk0p2 holds the per-unit factory MAC and serial number. A bounded
read on the reference unit returned

    26096911004C14;FCEE11004C14;F005;NEBULA V1.0.0.1;;;;;

and stock's wlan0 uses exactly fc:ee:11:00:4c:14. The value is programmed per
unit, exists nowhere else on the device, and cannot be regenerated. The vendor's
own erase policy deliberately skips it, and erase_list_preserves_sn_mac() exists
so that no package this project builds can close that gap.

SCOPE OF THIS MODULE

It is a fact table and two small helpers. An earlier revision also carried a GPT
parser and a GPT builder, written for a raw-disk-image approach that was
abandoned once the real .img format turned out to be the Creality OTA package.
Both were left behind, referenced by nothing, and one of them documented
behaviour that no longer existed. They have been removed rather than kept "in
case": dead code that describes a design the project rejected is worse than no
code at all.
