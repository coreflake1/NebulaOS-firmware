"""Validated partition targets: what the flashing layer CAN write, and what a
given operation MAY write.

THE DISTINCTION THIS MODULE EXISTS TO MAKE

Two different questions get confused constantly, and confusing them produces
either an unsafe tool or a uselessly narrow one:

    CAPABILITY  can the flashing layer express a validated, bounds-checked,
                read-back-verified write to this partition at all?
    POLICY      is THIS operation, run by THIS caller, allowed to select it?

The generic layer answers the first question broadly. The device belongs to its
owner, and a recovery tool that cannot rewrite the stock slot is not a recovery
tool. So `kernel`, `rootfs`, `rtos`, `rtos2` and the OTA marker are all
CAPABLE targets: full-device recovery, single-slot repair and both-sides
reinstall are all expressible here.

The developer `install` operation answers the second question narrowly. Its
policy is PRESERVE_STOCK: it selects kernel2, rootfs2 and the marker, and
nothing else. That is a property of that one operation, not a limit of the
backend, and the two must never be conflated - which is why they are separate
objects here rather than one hardcoded allowlist.

WHAT SAFETY IS MADE OF, SINCE IT IS NOT AN ALLOWLIST

  * targets are NAMED, never offsets. There is no API here that accepts a byte
    offset or a block device path, so no caller - trusted or not - can aim a
    write at an arbitrary location.
  * every target's offset and length come from the vendor Cloner geometry in
    tools/emmc/nebulaos_layout.py, which is evidence, not a guess.
  * every write is planned as (target, payload size, payload sha256) and the
    plan is validated against the target's real bounds before anything happens.
  * the payload must fit, and a plan that would run past the end of its
    partition is refused rather than truncated.

THE ONE UNCONDITIONAL REFUSAL

`sn_mac` is NEVER writable, under any policy, including full-device recovery.
It holds the per-unit factory MAC and serial number
(26096911004C14;FCEE11004C14;F005;NEBULA V1.0.0.1 on the reference unit, which
is the address stock's wlan0 actually uses). It is programmed per unit, exists
nowhere else on the device, and cannot be regenerated or bought. Every other
partition can, in principle, be restored from an image; this one cannot, so it
is excluded at the capability layer rather than left to policy. Even Creality's
own Cloner erase policy skips it.
