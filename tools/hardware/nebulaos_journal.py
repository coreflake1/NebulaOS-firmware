"""The transaction journal and the host lock.

THE JOURNAL IS ADVISORY. REALITY WINS.

This is the single most important thing about it. The journal records what the
installer BELIEVED was happening. The printer records what actually happened.
When they disagree, the device is right and the journal is stale - it was
written by a process that may have been killed between deciding to act and
acting, or before it could record that it had.

So nothing here is ever used as a substitute for observation. Before any
destructive resume, the caller re-observes device identity, which OS is running,
the active root, the boot id, the marker, slot-2 state and hashes, the staged
payload hashes and the flash lock - and then reconciles. The journal's job is to
say "a transaction was open, here is what it was for", which turns an
unexplained ARMED marker into a known one.

WHY IT IS KEYED THE WAY IT IS

    device id + control commit C + product commit X + xImage sha + rootfs sha

A transaction is only resumable if all five still hold. A different X, or a
rebuilt X whose artifacts differ, is a different transaction that happens to
involve the same printer, and resuming into it would install something nobody
asked for.

ATOMIC WRITES

Every update is written to a temporary file in the same directory, fsynced, then
renamed over the target. A journal truncated by a crash mid-write is worse than
no journal: it reads as a valid record of a state that was never reached.

THE HOST LOCK

One installer per device per host. Taken with O_EXCL so the check and the claim
are one operation - a "does the lock exist" test followed by a create is a race
with exactly the window that matters. The lock records pid and boot id so a lock
left by a crashed process can be recognised as stale rather than blocking
forever, and staleness is decided by whether that pid is still alive, not by an
age heuristic.

The device-side flash lock is separate and lives on the printer
(DeviceSession.acquire_flash_lock). Two hosts cannot see each other's host
locks, so the device-side one is what actually prevents two machines writing at
once. Both exist because they fail differently: the host lock gives a clean
local error, the device lock is the real mutual exclusion.
