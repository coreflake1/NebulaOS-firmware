"""Enrolled device profiles: who the printer is, and how to reach it safely.

WHY PROFILES EXIST OUTSIDE GIT

Three kinds of thing live here, and none of them belongs in a repository:

  * per-unit physical identity (eMMC CID, SHA-256 of the sn_mac partition)
  * per-OS SSH host keys, pinned
  * credential references and the credentials themselves

The first is device-specific and would be meaningless to anyone else. The second
and third are secrets. So the store is:

    ~/.config/nebulaos-hardware/devices/<device-id>/

with the same hygiene the attestation key gets: directory 0700, files 0600,
regular files only (lstat, so a planted symlink is refused rather than
followed), owned by the invoking user.

ENROLMENT IS A HUMAN ACT

This module READS profiles. It has no create() and no update-on-the-fly path,
because the moment an installer can enrol a device it can also enrol the wrong
one - and "first contact, record whatever answered" is precisely how a machine
that moved onto a remembered DHCP lease gets flashed.

A human creates the directory, records the identity from a device they have
physically confirmed, and pins the host keys. tools/hardware/enroll-device.sh
walks through it. That script is deliberately NOT in the set of launchers an
agent may run.

STRICT HOST KEYS, NO TOFU, NO REPINNING

Each profile pins a host key PER OS, because the stock slot and the NebulaOS
slot are different systems with different keys on the same physical printer.
Addressing the device while it runs stock uses the stock key; addressing it
while it runs NebulaOS uses the NebulaOS key. A key that does not match is a
refusal - never a prompt, never an automatic re-pin. If a key legitimately
changed (a reflash, a regenerated host key), a human re-enrols it.

AN ADDRESS IS NOT AN IDENTITY

The profile records address HISTORY per OS, which is a hint for rediscovery
after a reboot or a lease change - a list of places to look, in order. It is
never proof. Whatever answers is checked against the pinned physical identity
before anything destructive happens.
