"""The semantic operations an installer may perform on a printer.

WHY THIS IS AN INTERFACE AND NOT A PILE OF SSH CALLS

Two reasons, and the second is the important one.

First: every adversarial case this project needs to test - a wrong printer, a
host-key mismatch, a lease that moved, Stock unreachable, a print running, a
heater at temperature, a marker write that does not land, a crash while ARMED, a
dropped connection mid-flash, a hash mismatch, a second installer - is a
property of the DEVICE, not of SSH. Putting the device behind an interface means
all of them can be exercised offline against a simulator, which is the only way
any of them get tested before a real printer is at risk.

Second, and structurally: this class defines a CLOSED VOCABULARY. There is no
`run(command)` here, and no `read(device, offset, length)`. A caller can ask
"what is the marker", "is the printer idle", "write this plan" - it cannot ask
for an arbitrary command, an arbitrary block device or an arbitrary offset,
because no method takes one. That is what makes "the agent has no dd, no raw
offsets, no --command" a fact about the code rather than a promise about
behaviour.

Trusted internal code composes the real commands. It lives here, below the
interface, where it can be reviewed once.

THE SIMULATOR IS NOT IN THIS PACKAGE

Production code under tools/hardware/ contains no reference to any simulator and
no import path that could reach one. The simulator implements this same
interface and lives under tests/, so a shipped installer cannot construct it
even by accident - there is nothing to construct. Tests inject it.
