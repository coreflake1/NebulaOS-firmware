"""The Hardware Agent's operations, and the proofs each one requires.

THE PUBLIC INTERFACE IS SEMANTIC

    inspect   read-only: what is this printer, what is it running, what is on it
    status    read-only: is a transaction open, and what state is it in
    verify    read-only: does this printer currently run this exact build
    diagnose  read-only: a fixed, bounded report - processes, logs, MCU guard,
              update-supervisor state, Moonraker endpoints
    restart   repair: restart ONE named service with the update supervisor's
              semantics (see nebulaos_device.restart_script)
    install   the developer install, NebulaOS -> Stock -> flash -> NebulaOS

There is no ssh, scp, dd, marker, reboot, flash, raw usbboot, --host, --password
or --command. Not because they are filtered - because no such operation exists
here to name. The device is reached only through DeviceSession, whose vocabulary
is closed, and the target is chosen only by enrolled device id.

WHAT IS PROVEN BEYOND "ALL REPOS MUST BE CLEAN"

The launcher still runs the full online identity gate, which still requires all
five canonical repositories to be clean and published. On top of that blunt
rule, the agent proves the specific properties a hardware operation depends on:

    control commit C is published, resolvable, and content-bound
    host control code matches C exactly
    on-device helper bytes come from C's git objects
    product commit X is published
    X has a v2 attestation that verifies
    the attestation's digests equal the artifact bytes
    the build profile is release or candidate
    workspace topology, archive isolation and sentinels are valid

What is NOT relaxed: the full online identity gate still runs. A commit that was
never compared against the canonical remote is an unverified source generation,
and flashing is the least reversible boundary in the project.
