"""Two proofs: that Stock is a usable way out, and that an install really landed.

THE STOCK WAY-OUT PROOF

Setting the marker to ota:kernel while NebulaOS is running is the point of no
easy return. After the reboot, the only way to continue - or to undo anything -
is through the stock slot. If stock turns out to be unreachable, or its
credentials are wrong, or there is nowhere to stage the payload, the printer is
sitting on Creality's firmware with no automated path back, and the human has to
recover it by hand.

So every fact that the Stock half of the install depends on is checked BEFORE
the marker is touched, from NebulaOS, while retreat is still free. A missing
proof is a refusal, not a warning.

REAL PART-1 VERIFICATION

Checking that services are up is not verification that a specific build was
installed; a printer running last week's image also has services up. Part 1
compares the BYTES on the device against the exact artifacts that were supposed
to land, by hashing the same prefix length at the same partitions, and only then
looks at health.

And it reports PART1_INSTALL_VERIFIED, never HARDWARE_QUALIFIED. Part 1 proves
an image is installed and the system came up. Qualification means motion,
heating, calibration and printing, which are Part 2 and are not attempted here.
