"""The OTA marker: exact read, exact set, and an honest INDETERMINATE.

WHAT THE MARKER IS

/dev/mmcblk0p1 holds one of two strings that tell the vendor bootloader which
slot to boot next:

    ota:kernel    -> slot 1, Creality's stock
    ota:kernel2   -> slot 2, NebulaOS

This module owns the byte format and the parse. It performs no I/O: a caller
hands it 512 bytes read from the device and gets back a state, or asks it for
the exact bytes to write. That split is deliberate - it makes every rule here
testable without a printer, and it means the on-device transport cannot
accidentally reinterpret a marker.

THE PREFIX TRAP

"ota:kernel" is a prefix of "ota:kernel2". Any parse built on
`startswith("ota:kernel")` reports STOCK for a device that is actually set to
boot NebulaOS. That single mistake would make an installer reboot into the slot
it just decided not to boot, so the parse below never matches a bare prefix: it
matches the full token AND the terminator that follows it, and it checks the
longer token first.

WHY TWO TERMINATORS ARE VALID, AND WHY THAT IS NOT LOOSENESS

Two different writers produce this marker on a real device, and they disagree by
one byte:

    Creality's stock ota_utils.sh  mmc_write_str: `echo $str > $dev`  -> "ota:kernel\\n"
    NebulaOS's /etc/ota_marker.sh  printf '%s\\n\\n'                    -> "ota:kernel\\n\\n"

and ballaswag/ingenic-usbboot checks `strncmp(ota, "ota:kernel\\n", 11)`, which
accepts either. A parser that demanded "\\n\\n" would call a perfectly
well-defined stock-written marker INDETERMINATE, and the installer would then
refuse to reboot a device whose state was never actually in doubt.

So both forms are accepted - as an ENUMERATED SET, not as a prefix match or a
strip(). Anything outside that set is INDETERMINATE. Writing always emits the
canonical two-newline form, so a marker this project wrote is unambiguous even
though it tolerates the other one on read.

INDETERMINATE IS A RESULT, NOT AN ERROR

It means "the next boot target cannot be predicted from these bytes". The only
correct response is to refuse to reboot. Guessing, defaulting, or retrying a
blind toggle are all ways of turning an unknown state into a coin flip on which
OS comes up - and one of those faces auto-flashes the MCU.

CREALITY'S TOGGLE IS NEVER USED AUTONOMOUSLY

From stock, `local_set_next_boot_device` takes no argument: it flips to whatever
the marker currently is not. That is unusable for automation, because the caller
cannot state an intent and the return value does not say where it landed. This
module only ever expresses "set kernel" or "set kernel2", and the transport that
executes it verifies by reading the bytes back.
