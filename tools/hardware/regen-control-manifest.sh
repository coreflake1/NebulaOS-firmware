# Regenerate tools/hardware/CONTROL_MANIFEST.
#
# The manifest pins every privileged file by content, at the control commit that
# contains it. Two kinds, with different guarantees - see nebulaos_control.py:
#
#   on-device  staged onto the printer; its bytes are read from the git object
#              at C, so the working tree cannot influence what gets sent.
#   host       control modules the launcher itself executes; Python imports them
#              from disk, so the running copies are COMPARED against C and any
#              difference refuses the operation.
#
# Run this after changing any privileged file, then commit the manifest IN THE
# SAME COMMIT as the change. A manifest that lags its files makes every
# privileged operation refuse, which is the correct failure but an annoying one
# to debug at 2am.
