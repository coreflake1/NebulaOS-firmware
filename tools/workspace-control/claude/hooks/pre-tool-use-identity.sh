# --- privileged execution boundary -----------------------------------------
# The ONLY way a command escapes Claude sandbox in this build is the Bash tool
# dangerouslyDisableSandbox parameter. Measured on this host: an unsandboxed
# shell regains the user full supplementary group set, gid 972 included, which
# is the container group. So "may reach the container engine" and "may do
# anything as this user" are the same grant.
#
# Enforced here rather than in agent frontmatter because scoped Bash grants
# are not enforced in this build - see the note under read-only reviewers.
#
# Exactly these caller/file pairs may run unsandboxed, each running one file:
#
#   nebulaos-build     tools/run-nebulaos-build.sh <40-hex sha>
#   nebulaos-hardware  tools/run-nebulaos-hardware.sh <semantic operation>
#   main agent         tools/run-nebulaos-hardware.sh <any operation but install>
#
# The main agent is the session's own principal: a payload with NO agent_type
# key. A present-but-blank, null, padded or non-string agent_type is not the
# main agent and not any other principal. The main agent may diagnose, verify
# and restart a service, but not install: a flash nobody asked for stays
# mechanically impossible for it, not merely against policy.
#
# What makes that mechanical is the UNSANDBOXED check, where the whole command
# must be one lone launcher invocation. The sandboxed check of rule 3 is an
# early, explanatory refusal only: it reads the plain command, and wrappers or
# globs can get past it. That does not matter, because a sandboxed launcher
# cannot reach a printer - no network, and the credential store is denied by
# settings.json denyRead.
#
# The control-layer sync is deliberately NOT such a pair. An earlier revision
# granted the main agent an unsandboxed sync, to resolve what looked like a
# deadlock: this build sandboxes .claude/hooks read-only, so a sandboxed sync
# cannot install a hook change, and an agent that edits the canonical hook then
# cannot install it. That read-only path is not only an obstacle - it is the
# property that stops an agent installing its own authority layer. The main
# agent CAN edit canonical hooks, settings, agent definitions and the authority
# documents, because those are ordinary tracked source; before that grant the
# edit was inert, and after it one sanctioned command made it live. Installing
# the authority layer requires a human running the sync out of band. That is
# the control, not a defect, and the installer says so when it fails.
#
# BINDING IS BY CONTENT, NOT BY PATH. Comparing realpath(allowed) against
# realpath(typed) is satisfied by NAMING the path: both sides derive from the
# same string, so it is true for whatever file occupies it. The workspace root
# is not a git repository and tools/ is unversioned derived state that this
# sandbox permits writing, so a path-only check would let any caller overwrite
# the launcher and have this hook run it with host privilege. Before allowing
# the escape, the target bytes are compared against the tracked canonical blob
# at firmware HEAD. An uncommitted or altered launcher is refused.
#
# Rules:
#   1. the container engine invoked directly in COMMAND POSITION is refused for
#      every caller. This is an affordance against accident, NOT containment:
#      indirect forms (xargs, find -exec, sh -c) are not matched, and cannot be
#      in general. The real containment is that a sandboxed caller has no
#      socket, and that the launcher reaches the engine through build.sh as a
#      subprocess this hook structurally never observes.
#   2. dangerouslyDisableSandbox is refused unless the request is the pair
#      above, with verified content, no chaining, no wrapper and no extra
#      arguments.
#   3. each launcher is refused to every caller but its own principals,
#      sandboxed or not: the build launcher to nebulaos-build; the hardware
#      launcher to nebulaos-hardware, and to the main agent for every operation
#      except install.
#   4. the hardware agent is refused device-contact commands outright. It
#      reaches a printer only through its launcher, whose command word is not
#      in the refused set.
#
# Fail-closed SCOPE: if the interpreter cannot run, the request is refused when
# it asked for privilege, OR named a launcher path, OR names an engine. Rules
# that apply to sandboxed requests would otherwise vanish silently along with
# the interpreter.

# --- read-only reviewers ---------------------------------------------------
# nebula-architect and nebula-verifier have no Edit/Write/NotebookEdit tool,
# but they DO have Bash - and this build's sandbox permits writes inside the
# working directory, which is the workspace. Scoped Bash grants in agent
# frontmatter were tested against this build and are NOT enforced (a command
# outside the granted scope ran normally), so the tool list cannot carry this
# property on its own.
#
# The PreToolUse payload carries agent_type for subagent calls and omits it for
# the main agent, so enforcement happens here. Classification is done in Python:
# shell glob matching got this wrong (it missed `git -C <path> commit`, because
# the -C option breaks token adjacency), and a guard that looks right while
# missing the obvious case is worse than none.
#
# This is a command-pattern guard, deliberately the third layer - behind the
# absent edit tools and the agents' own instructions - not a kernel boundary.

  # derived copies stale by design; stale copies then deny every Edit, Write
  # and Bash - including tools/sync-workspace-control.sh, the very command
  # the deny message below tells you to run. The repair sits inside the blast
  # radius of the fault, so the layer cannot be maintained at all.
  #
  # The exception opens exactly one command, and only when ALL of:
  #   - every gate failure is control-file drift that the sync repairs. Any
  #     other failure - repo identity, stale source generation, topology,
  #     sentinels, a missing canonical MANIFEST - still denies. Source
  #     identity is never bypassable this way.
  #   - the caller is the main agent. nebula-architect and nebula-verifier
  #     are refused here and, independently, by the reviewer guard above.
  #   - the tool is Bash and the command is a lone invocation of the canonical
  #     sync: no chaining, no redirection, no substitution, no extra
  #     arguments. `sync && rm -rf x` is not a sync.
  #   - the script resolves, through realpath, to the installed copy or the
  #     tracked canonical copy. Relative spellings resolve against the
  #     caller's reported cwd and are refused when cwd is unknown, so an
  #     earlier `cd` cannot aim the exception at some other file.

  # The archive and launch-location guards ran earlier and have already
  # denied, so neither is reachable from here.
