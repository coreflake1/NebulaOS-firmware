# SessionStart hook - inject a SMALL, current identity summary.
#
# Purpose: architectural identity must be present in context from the first
# token, and must survive compaction. This deliberately injects facts only -
# no project history, no narrative. Pages of history are what caused agents to
# reason from stale prose in the first place.
#
#   session-start.sh             startup | resume | clear
#   session-start.sh --compact   after compaction
#
# Both use the DEV gate: fast and offline. The online canonical-remote check is
# a RELEASE concern (tools/verify-workspace-identity.sh --release).
#
# Never blocks a session: a hook that hard-fails on startup would make the
# workspace unusable offline. It reports status; PreToolUse is what fails closed.

# --- build / qualification status, DERIVED ---------------------------------

# reporting NO after a build had in fact been verified, and would have kept
# reporting NO forever, which trains a reader to ignore the line entirely.

# CURRENT_HEAD_BUILD_VERIFIED is now answered by the build launcher's own
# attestation (.nebulaos-build-verified, written only on a clean successful
# build) for the CURRENT firmware HEAD. A build of some earlier generation is
# deliberately not evidence about this one - the whole point of the field is to
# say whether THIS source has been built.
#
# Bounded on purpose: a plain glob over one directory, no find, no du, no
# network. This runs at session start and must stay cheap.

DEV: edit, test, commit freely. Strict only at the printer, the privilege
