# NebulaOS Hardware Agent launcher - the ONLY route from an agent to a printer,
# and the only command an agent may run outside Claude's sandbox to get there.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# The PreToolUse hook refuses ssh/scp/sftp/ping/nc/socat/... to the hardware
# agent outright, with no target-bound exception, and that refusal STAYS. The
# main agent has no network inside the sandbox and no access to the credential
# store. Both reach hardware only by invoking this file. All device contact is
# encapsulated below, where it can be constrained and reviewed, rather than
# spelled out ad hoc in agent-authored shell.
#
# WHO MAY RUN IT (enforced by the PreToolUse hook, not by this file)
#
#   nebulaos-hardware   every operation
#   main agent          every operation
#   anyone else         nothing
#
# Like the build launcher, the escape is bound to this file by REAL PATH **and by
# CONTENT**: the installed copy's bytes must equal the tracked canonical blob at
# firmware HEAD. Path identity alone is not enough - tools/ is unversioned
# derived state the sandbox permits writing, so naming an allowed path could
# otherwise run arbitrary code with host privilege.
#
# THE INTERFACE IS SEMANTIC
#
#   run-nebulaos-hardware.sh --device <id> --control <C> inspect
#   run-nebulaos-hardware.sh --device <id> --control <C> status
#   run-nebulaos-hardware.sh --device <id> --control <C> diagnose
#   run-nebulaos-hardware.sh --device <id> --control <C> restart <service>
#   run-nebulaos-hardware.sh --device <id> --control <C> verify  <X> <ximage-sha256> <rootfs-sha256>
#   run-nebulaos-hardware.sh --device <id> --control <C> install <X> <ximage-sha256> <rootfs-sha256>
#
# There is no --host, --password, --command, ssh, scp, dd, marker, reboot, flash
# or raw usbboot - not filtered, absent. The target is an ENROLLED DEVICE ID, not
# an address: an address is not an identity, DHCP moves leases, and the machine
# answering at a remembered IP may be a different one. Which addresses may be
# spoken to at all is a property of the human-created device profile.
#
# C AND X
#
#   C  the control commit: the reviewed, published source of every privileged
#      helper. Stated explicitly so that installing an OLD product still uses
#      CURRENT control machinery.
#   X  the product commit being installed. Payload and data only.
#
# THIS LAUNCHER REIMPLEMENTS NOTHING
#
# Every partition write is performed by scripts/flash-spare-slot.sh, ON the
# device, whose bytes are read from C's git objects. That script owns the slot
# model, the live-target collision refusal, the capacity checks and the
# post-write read-back, and it has its own offline test suite. This file is a
# gate and a courier.
#
# REPAIRS
#
# `restart` is the only repair: one service from a closed list (klipper,
# moonraker, guppyscreen, webcam, nginx), with the on-device update supervisor's
# stop/wait/start and print-idle semantics, refused while that supervisor holds a
# lock or is validating. A RELEASE-mode device additionally requires a published
# control commit. There is deliberately no package install: the Moonraker venv lives
# in persistent /usr/data, so a repair there would outlive the next install and
# hide a broken image. Product defects are fixed in the product and reinstalled.
#
# PART 1 SCOPE ONLY
#
# Nothing here homes an axis, moves a motor, heats a nozzle or bed, extrudes,
# calibrates, starts a print, or flashes the MCU. Those are Part 2 and are
# deliberately absent, not merely discouraged.
