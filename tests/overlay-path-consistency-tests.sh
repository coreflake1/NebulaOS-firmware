# The rootfs overlay path must mean the same thing in all three places that
# name it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Relocating the overlay out of the upstream Buildroot
# checkout into br2-external/ required changing it in three independent files.
# One was missed - scripts/build/04-cross-compile-app-stack.sh kept the old
# literal - and the failure mode was genuinely nasty:
#
#   - stage 02 populated the NEW overlay directory
#   - stage 04 wrote the ENTIRE application payload (Klipper, Moonraker,
#     Mainsail, GuppyScreen) into the OLD one, which Buildroot never reads
#   - stage 05 would have produced a rootfs that built perfectly cleanly and
#     simply contained no application stack at all
#
# It happened to fail instead, but only ~1400 lines later on an unrelated
# missing directory, which points nowhere near the real divergence. A silent
# success would have been worse: an image that boots to no printer software.
#
# So this asserts agreement directly, cheaply, with no build required.
#
# Exit: 0 PASS, 1 FAIL, 2 SKIP.
