# Offline, repeatable tests for scripts/flash-spare-slot.sh's preflight
# and slot-selection logic (final-seal mission, 2026-07-27). Runs
# entirely against fixture files/symlinks under a temp directory - never
# touches a real block device, and never requires root (fixtures are
# plain regular files/symlinks standing in for /dev nodes, which is
# exactly why is_real_device() in the production script has a relaxed
# fixture-mode check).
#
# This sources the actual production script (scripts/flash-spare-slot.sh)
# for every case - there is deliberately no second/parallel copy of the
# safety logic here to drift out of sync with it.
#
# Known, honest coverage gap: dev_id()'s major:minor cross-check in
# verify_slot_labels() only ever activates for real block special files
# (`[ -b ]`) - fixtures here are plain regular files/symlinks (creating
# real block devices needs root), so that specific check is structurally
# a no-op for every case below, every time. It is real-hardware-only and
# was already the source of one real bug found live (Phase E, 2026-07-27
# - `ls -ldn` doesn't dereference symlinks, `-ldnL` does) that this
# offline suite could not have caught. Live qualification against real
# hardware remains load-bearing for that one check; do not treat a clean
# run of this suite alone as proof it still works.
