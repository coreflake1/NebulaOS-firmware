# Offline, repeatable tests for the migration-backup pruning extension to
# /etc/nebulaos-retention.sh (Phase 2 final software closure mission,
# 2026-09-09, section 2D).
#
# A real device found live had accumulated ~1.6GB under
# $NEBULAOS_ROOT/system/migration-backups (95% of a 5.9GB /usr/data
# partition, 260MB free) - almost entirely from S04nebulaos-migrate's
# reseed_git_app() writing a full klipper+moonraker+nebulaos-klipper-
# extensions checkout backup into a new BACKUP_ROOT/<ISO8601-timestamp>/
# directory on every migration run, forever, with no pruning at all. This
# extends the EXISTING retention mechanism (clean_old_config_backups()/
# clean_obsolete_versions()'s already-established "age +7 days, keep
# newest N" policy) rather than inventing a second one.
#
# Usage: sh tests/nebulaos-retention-migration-backup-pruning-tests.sh
