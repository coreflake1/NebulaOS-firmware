# Offline, structural tests for S01persistent-datastore's new second bind
# mount of guppyconfig.json onto printer_data/config/guppyscreen/ (Phase 2
# final software closure mission, 2026-09-09, section 8).
#
# S01persistent-datastore does real `mount`/`mount --bind` calls requiring
# root and a real block device - it has no existing offline test harness at
# all (a pre-existing gap this mission does not fully close). This file
# proves the SOURCE is structurally correct (both bind mounts target the
# exact same real file, the new mount point is created before being bound
# onto, nothing else under guppyscreen/ - binaries, themes/ - is exposed);
# full functional proof (the file really is visible and editable through
# Mainsail after a real boot) happens live during first-boot acceptance.
#
# Usage: sh tests/guppyscreen-config-exposure-tests.sh
