# Phase 1.5 persistent-namespace mission (2026-08). Namespace-architecture
# guard: a lightweight lint over the tracked overlay source that makes the
# exact class of regression this mission fixed (a top-level compatibility
# symlink silently aliasing NebulaOS's own private state under a
# stock-shared path, or NebulaOS-specific state landing on the shared
# credentials path) visible in CI/build validation instead of needing a
# human to notice it again.
#
# Deliberately NOT a naive "grep for /usr/data and flag every hit" - that
# would flag the one legitimate exception (the shared gcode path) along
# with everything else. The allowlist below is small and each entry is
# commented with why it is allowed, per this mission's own governing brief.
#
# Usage: sh tests/nebulaos-namespace-ownership-tests.sh

# /usr/data/printer_data (bare, NOT /usr/data/printer_data/gcodes) and
# /usr/data/guppyscreen used to be whole-directory symlinks into NebulaOS's
# own private /opt/printer_data and /opt/guppyscreen trees - removed this
# mission because they silently aliased NebulaOS's ENTIRE private state
# under a stock-shared path (or, on a device with real prior stock content
# there, silently did nothing and let NebulaOS's own writes land inside
# stock's directory instead). Any new occurrence of either bare path in
# active code is exactly this regression coming back.

#     the old paths in prose. A comment cannot execute, so it cannot
#     reintroduce the namespace-ownership bug - only a live path literal
#     in real code can.
