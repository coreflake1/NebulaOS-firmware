# Persistent-venv platform-compatibility migration tests.

# Exercises the REAL helpers in
# scripts/build/overlay/usr/libexec/nebulaos-venv-lib.sh by sourcing that file
# - not a reimplementation of them - against fake venvs on disk.
#
# What is being protected (mission section 15):
#   - a usable venv is KEPT, untouched (provisioning is idempotent)
#   - a torn or non-functional venv is REPROVISIONED, including the shape the
#     old `[ -x bin/python3 ]` guard got wrong: interpreter present, env not
#     actually usable
#   - a corrupt venv is replaced
#   - a failed replacement does NOT destroy the existing environment
#   - an interrupted rename-swap is recoverable on the next boot
#   - repeated runs are idempotent
#
# The fake interpreter is a shell script: the predicate only ever execs it and
# runs an import smoke test, both of which a script can answer
# deterministically, so the suite does not depend on the host's python.

# that basis alone. Asserted explicitly so that the day someone adds version
# awareness (the first post-release Python ABI transition - see
