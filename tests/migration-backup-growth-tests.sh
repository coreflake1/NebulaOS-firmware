# D-01 regression: a persistent deterministic reseed failure must NOT create
# boot-proportional backup growth.
#
# This is the suite that would have caught the amplifier. Before the fix, a
# deterministic failure produced one $BACKUP_ROOT/<UTC timestamp> directory per
# boot, forever, holding a full klipper+moonraker tree each - a real device
# reached ~1.6GB / 95% of a 5.9GB /usr/data. Retention reclaims nothing for
# seven days (nebulaos-retention.sh:279 filters -mtime +7 BEFORE the keep
# count), and emergency_gcode_cleanup deletes the user's print files rather
# than migration backups, so "retention will handle it" was never true.
#
# Every case here drives the REAL S04nebulaos-migrate start() against throwaway
# fixtures. Nothing touches the canonical checkout.
