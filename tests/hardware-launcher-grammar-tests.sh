# The Hardware Agent launcher's grammar, exercised against the real script.
#
# WHY A FAKE WORKSPACE ROOT
#
# The launcher's first act is a structural check that it is sitting inside a
# real NebulaOS workspace - which is correct, and which also means the grammar
# below it can never be reached from a test directory. So this builds a minimal
# fake root with a passing gate stub and an agent stub that echoes what it was
# handed. The code under test is the REAL launcher, byte for byte; only its
# surroundings are stubbed, and the stubs are the two things the grammar does
# not depend on.
#
# WHAT IS BEING ASSERTED
#
# That the removed surface is genuinely gone. The old launcher accepted
# `--host <private-ipv4>` and six implementation-level subcommands including
# `flash`, `marker` and `reboot`. The new one accepts an enrolled device id, a
# control commit, and four semantic operations - and every one of the old
# spellings must now be refused, or the surface was not actually removed.
