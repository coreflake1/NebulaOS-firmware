# Offline tests for the Phase 1 overnight closure mission's Mission H fix:
# scripts/build/assert-baseline-config.sh's new `candidate-post-build` mode.
#
# Problem this closes: `post-build` mode's own QUALIFIED_BASELINE_TAG
# comparison is a strict "did anything at all change vs the last hardware-
# qualified artifact" gate - correct for reproducing an already-qualified
# baseline, but it ALWAYS and CORRECTLY fails for a legitimate candidate
# that contains new, not-yet-hardware-qualified source changes (exactly
# what every Phase 1.9 build is). `candidate-post-build` keeps every real
# per-variant Kconfig/DTS assertion (BUILD_VERIFIED) but reports the
# baseline diff as informational only, never as a gate - promoting
# QUALIFIED_BASELINE_TAG itself remains a separate, deliberate, manually
# reviewed action this mode never performs.
#
# Requires a real build's resolved artifacts (kernel.config, halley5_v30.dts)
# to already exist under artifacts/buildroot-halley5-v30-image/ - skips
# cleanly if they don't (this is exactly the situation before any build has
# run yet, e.g. a fresh checkout).
#
# Usage: sh tests/candidate-vs-qualified-baseline-tests.sh
