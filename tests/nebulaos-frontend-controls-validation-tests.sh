# Offline, repeatable tests for the print-control config closure validator
# (mainline print-controls mission, 2026-07-29, see
# docs/NEBULAOS_FRONTEND_PRINT_CONTROLS.md). This is the build gate that
# must fail the image build if the factory printer_data/config seed is
# missing, or has duplicate definitions of, virtual_sdcard/pause_resume/
# display_status/PAUSE/RESUME/CANCEL_PRINT.
#
# Sources scripts/build/lib/validate-frontend-controls.sh directly - the
# exact functions scripts/build/04-cross-compile-app-stack.sh calls against
# the real overlay source - so these tests exercise the actual build gate,
# not a second/parallel reimplementation of its rules (same convention as
# tests/factory-seed-git-tests.sh and scripts/build/lib/make-seed-archive.sh).
# Never touches a real device or /usr/data.

# Usage: sh tests/nebulaos-frontend-controls-validation-tests.sh
