# Offline, repeatable tests for:
#   - scripts/build/overlay/etc/nebulaos-display-qualified.sh (the config
#     format, atomic writer, validator, and debugfs-apply logic, including
#     the touch_wake_mode field and the sleep/touch-wake watcher-starting
#     logic in ndq_apply_deferred_fields())
#   - scripts/build/overlay/etc/init.d/S97nebulaos-display-qualified-apply
#     (the health-gated boot-time wrapper around it, including the display-
#     itself health gate)
#   - scripts/build/overlay/usr/libexec/nebulaos-display-qualified-write
#     (the human-operator manual-write helper)
#
# The touch-wake watcher daemon's OWN tick/loop logic (nebulaos-display-
# sleep-wake-controller.sh / S98nebulaos-display-sleep-wake-controller) has
# its own, separate test file:
# tests/nebulaos-display-sleep-wake-controller-tests.sh - kept apart the
# same way tests/nebulaos-camera-idle-controller-tests.sh is kept apart
# from this file, rather than growing this already-large suite further.
#
# HONESTY NOTE (read before trusting a green run here as more than it is):
# there is no running kernel and no live BusyBox init system available
# from this environment. Every debugfs interaction below is a fake file
# tree, not a real ns2009_final_qualification/nebulaos_backlight_final_
# controller kernel driver - what these tests genuinely prove is this
# project's own userspace logic (parsing, checksum, validation ordering,
# the atomic-write durability sequence, the apply script's health-gating
# and abort-on-first-failure sequencing, and its real position in the
# init.d boot order). They do NOT and cannot prove the real kernel
# drivers behave as their patches document - only live hardware
# qualification can do that.
#
# Usage: sh tests/nebulaos-display-qualified-tests.sh
