# Audit finding F-11. scripts/build/overlay/opt/printer_data/config/
# GuppyScreen/scripts/static_ip.py is owned by NebulaOS-guppyscreen
# (k1/scripts/static_ip.py). The firmware repo carries a copy because the
# compiled guppyscreen binary hardcodes the runtime path
# /opt/printer_data/config/GuppyScreen/scripts/static_ip.py
# (NebulaOS-guppyscreen/src/static_ip_panel.cpp:12), so the file must be
# present in the shipped printer_data config tree.
#
# That copy silently reverted a fix that had already landed upstream of it.
# GUPPYSCREEN_PIN 5f1911ac - subject "fix(paths): route NebulaOS-owned state
# through /opt bind mounts, not /usr/data top-level aliases" - moved
# static_ip.py's state off the retired /usr/data/printer_data alias, which
# overlaps stock's shared tree. A later firmware commit restored the file
# "byte-identical from a live, already-qualified device", and the device it
# was taken from predated that fix, so the two reverted lines came back. The
# copy had no mechanical link to the canonical version, so nothing noticed.
#
# This test is that link. It is deliberately a byte-for-byte comparison
# against the OWNING repository at the exact GUPPYSCREEN_PIN the firmware
# manifest ships - not a spot-check of the two lines that happened to drift
# last time.
#
# Usage: sh tests/guppyscreen-owned-files-tests.sh
