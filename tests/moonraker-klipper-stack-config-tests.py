"""Offline validation of the shipped Moonraker configuration for the Klipper
stack. Phase 1 no-fork migration, Phase J.

This does not run Moonraker. It does something more useful for a config file
that has to be right before a printer boots: it re-implements Moonraker's own
include and parse rules, and then checks every option this project sets
against Moonraker's REAL source at the pinned commit - so "these options are
supported" is verified rather than asserted from memory.

That distinction is not theoretical here. The shipped moonraker.conf already
carries a long comment about a previous round of exactly this mistake: seven
options were set on the reserved [update_manager klipper] slot, every one of
them silently ignored, each surfacing as an "Unparsed config option" warning
on every boot of a byte-for-byte fresh install. The checks below exist so
that cannot happen again quietly.

Moonraker's source is located automatically (vendor/moonraker, or the
workspace's reference clone) and can be pointed at explicitly with
MOONRAKER_SRC. Without it the source-derived checks are reported as skipped
rather than silently passing.
