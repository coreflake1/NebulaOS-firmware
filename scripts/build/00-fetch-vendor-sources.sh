# no-fork migration this was coreflake1/NebulaOS-klipper, a fork whose only
# real content was klippy/extras/ files this project wrote - everything
# else different from upstream was inherited base-fork lineage nobody here
# had ever needed. Those files now live in vendor/nebulaos-klipper-
# extensions below and are composed into this checkout at boot by symlink
# activation, so this tree is genuinely upstream's, byte for byte, and
# stays that way at runtime (git status --porcelain empty, on the device,
# always). Zero core Klipper patches are applied here or anywhere else.
# SHALLOW, deliberately, and this is a size decision with a hard number
# behind it. make_seed_archive() archives this checkout's real .git verbatim
# into /opt/nebulaos-seeds/klipper.tar.gz, which the squashfs carries and a
# 208MB-RAM device extracts on first boot. The retired fork's full history
# was 33MB and produced a 36.9MB seed (measured with debugfs against the last
# qualified image, nightly-2026-08-15). Official Klipper3d/klipper's full
# history is 242MB and produced a 256MB seed - 6.6x larger, +217MB in the
# rootfs, on a 500MB partition, for history nothing on the printer reads.
#
# Found by the first real full build of this branch, which overflowed
# BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_EXT2_SIZE. Raising that size would have "fixed" the
# symptom and shipped the 217MB.
#
# Depth 1 is sufficient for everything the device actually does with this
# repository. Moonraker's GitDeploy needs a clean tree, branch.<name>.remote
# /merge config, and HEAD reachable from origin/master after a fetch - git
# deepens a shallow clone automatically to satisfy that walk. Verified
