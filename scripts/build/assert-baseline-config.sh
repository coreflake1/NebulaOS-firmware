# Phase 2 baseline assertions (baseline-canonicalization-and-z_compensate-
# deployment mission, 2026-08-06/07). Fails loudly and immediately if any
# qualified-baseline feature is missing - "do not accept script exit status
# as proof" (the mission's own words): apply-qualified-baseline.sh exiting
# 0 only means each variant script itself didn't error, not that the
# resulting *build* actually contains what it's supposed to. This script
# checks the real, resolved artifacts instead.
#
# Three modes:
#   sh scripts/build/assert-baseline-config.sh pre-build
#     Run AFTER apply-qualified-baseline.sh, BEFORE 02/03/05 - checks the
#     vendor kernel tree's source-level state (Kconfig symbols exist, DTS
#     nodes present) so a missing patch is caught before spending build time.
#     This is what "SOURCE_VERIFIED" means (see Phase 1 overnight closure
#     mission, Mission H): every accepted variant's source-level change is
#     actually present, nothing about whether it compiled or matches any
#     prior hardware-qualified state.
#   sh scripts/build/assert-baseline-config.sh post-build
#     Run AFTER 05-final-build.sh to REPRODUCE an ALREADY hardware-qualified
#     baseline byte/semantically-exactly (used by build-qualified-
#     baseline.sh's own wrapper, and for regression-testing a change against
#     a frozen, already-qualified reference). Any difference from
#     QUALIFIED_BASELINE_TAG is a FAILURE here, by design - this mode's
#     entire purpose is proving nothing drifted from what was already
#     qualified. Do NOT use this mode to evaluate a candidate that
#     legitimately contains new, not-yet-hardware-qualified source changes -
#     it will always and correctly report FAIL for those, since "identical
#     to the last qualified baseline" is precisely what a real candidate is
#     not yet.
#   sh scripts/build/assert-baseline-config.sh candidate-post-build
#     Added by the Phase 1 overnight closure mission (Mission H): the same
#     resolved-artifact Kconfig/DTS assertions as post-build (so a real
#     candidate is still proven to actually contain everything every
#     accepted variant is supposed to produce - this is "BUILD_VERIFIED"),
#     but the QUALIFIED_BASELINE_TAG comparison is reported as an
#     INFORMATIONAL diff, never a gate - a legitimate candidate is EXPECTED
#     to differ from the last hardware-qualified baseline (that's what
#     makes it a candidate). Nothing in this repository calls a build
#     "hardware-qualified" merely because this mode passes; promoting
#     QUALIFIED_BASELINE_TAG to a new value remains a separate, deliberate,
#     manually-reviewed edit to manifests/dependencies.conf made only after
#     real hardware qualification - this mode never touches that file.

	# hash of every commit downstream of the earliest one touched, including
	# this baseline tag's own target. A hardcoded SHA silently breaks across

	# stopped resolving to any object at all in the rewritten repo, and this
	# whole check failed with a confusing FAIL instead of a clear "commit not
	# found" error). The tag name itself is stable across the rewrite - git

	# 2026-08-14 (Phase 11 verification-gate fix): a hardcoded tag NAME goes

	# fresh-build run hit exactly this, correctly reporting FAIL against a
