# writes the ota partition marker in the exact byte format both Creality's
# own stock ota_utils.sh (mmc_write_str: `echo $str > $dev`) and
# ballaswag/ingenic-usbboot's swap_ota_partition() (writes "ota:kernel\n\n"
# into a zeroed 512-byte buffer) use. Verified byte-for-byte via a local
# regular-file simulation before ever being trusted on real hardware -
# tested output was an exact match for the live device's own raw partition
# dump: "6f 74 61 3a 6b 65 72 6e 65 6c 0a 0a 00 00 ...".
#
# A bare `echo -n "ota:kernel"` (10 bytes, no trailing newline) would NOT
# match usbboot's own read-check (`strncmp(ota, "ota:kernel\n", 11)`) and
# would fall into its "unexpected value" branch unless --force-swap-ota is
# used - this exists specifically to avoid that mismatch.
