# NebulaOS mutable-runtime mission, Phase 8: rollback orchestration and
# transaction state machine (docs/NEBULAOS_UPDATE_AND_ROLLBACK_DESIGN.md).
#
# Real constraint found while implementing this (not present in the design
# draft): this Moonraker version's update_manager (git_deploy.py/
# app_deploy.py, confirmed directly against vendor/moonraker source) has NO
# pre/post-update command hook at all - it performs fetch, checkout,
# venv/requirement sync, and service restart entirely on its own the moment
# a user clicks "update" in Mainsail, with no way for external code to run
# in between "new version staged" and "new version activated". The design
# doc's Stage 1 (pre-activation) / Stage 2 (post-activation) split is
# therefore collapsed here into a single post-hoc validation that runs
# after Moonraker has already restarted the affected service - this script
# is an independent poller, not a Moonraker plugin, specifically so it
# keeps working even if a bad update breaks Moonraker itself.
#
# Detection: git's own HEAD commit is polled per component. A change from
# the last-recorded value means "an update just happened" (via Moonraker's
# own update flow, or a manual git operation - this script does not care
# which). Rollback restores the previous known-good commit via
# `git reset --hard`, which needs no separate pre-update backup step for
# the source tree itself - git's own history/reflog already holds it,
# which is why known_good_commit is tracked here rather than snapshotting
# whole directory copies.
#
# Restart safety: never restarts a service while a print is active/paused
# (read-only Moonraker query, checked immediately before every restart -
# same printer-safety invariant as every other disruptive action in this
# project) - a deferred restart just waits and rechecks rather than
# skipping validation outright.
#
# NebulaOS mutable-runtime closure mission (2026-07-27), Phase D: Moonraker
# source and virtualenv are now one versioned release unit, not two
# independently-rolled-back things. Real gap this closes: Moonraker's own
# app_deploy.py._update_python_requirements() installs into the EXISTING
# venv in place whenever a commit changes requirements.txt - a plain
# `git reset --hard` on the source alone does nothing to undo whatever pip
# already did to the venv. Rather than re-implementing Moonraker's own
# in-place venv update logic (real risk of fighting/duplicating it), this
# supervisor instead maintains its own full backup of the venv, refreshed
# every time a (source, venv) pairing is confirmed healthy together, and
# always restores BOTH halves together on rollback - since only one paired
# backup ever exists at a time and both halves are always reset in the same
# step, there is no code path that can produce a mismatched pair.

# NebulaOS Phase 1 no-fork migration (2026-08-17), Phase I: the validated,
# rollback-able unit for the Klipper side is now the PAIR
# (klipper_sha, extensions_sha), not Klipper alone.
#
# Why the pair has to be the unit, concretely. NebulaOS runs official,
# unmodified Klipper with its own modules composed in from a separately
# updatable repository, and Moonraker can update either half independently -
# it has no cross-component ordering, no dependency gate, and no post-update
# hook. Two failure modes follow directly:
#
#   * new Klipper + old extensions: a Klipper update that touches any file
#     in klippy/chelper/ makes the shipped cross-compiled c_helper.so older
#     than a source, so Klipper's own mtime check decides to rebuild it with
#     gcc - which this device does not have. Klippy does not start. An API
#     rename lands here too: mainline already renamed
#     MCU.register_response() to register_serial_response() once.
#   * new extensions + old Klipper: the extension set's own preflight
#     refuses to load against a Klipper it was not qualified against, which
#     is the designed behaviour, but leaves the printer down until something
#     puts the pair back together.
#
# So this file keeps ONE shared lock, ONE known-good record naming both
# commits, and ONE validation that either promotes both halves or rolls back
# both. A known-good pair is never recorded until both halves have actually
# passed - there is no code path that can record commit A paired with a
# snapshot belonging to a different commit, the same property
# moonraker_snapshot_env/moonraker_restore_env already give the Moonraker
# source+venv pairing below, and this is deliberately modelled on it rather
# than being a second, parallel transaction framework.
#
# Recomposition is part of the transaction, not a side effect: after any
# change to either half, the symlink set is rebuilt and re-verified BEFORE
# Klippy is restarted, which is also when the collision guard and the
# c_helper.so mtime invariant get re-run. A stale library is caught here and
# refused, instead of surfacing as a gcc crash part-way through boot.

# Paths and timings are overridable purely so the offline scenario tests in
# tests/klipper-stack-update-tests.sh can drive this file against fixture
# directories and stubbed services instead of a printer - the same seam
# convention S02/S04/S05 already use for SEEDS/APPS/SYSTEM/LOCKDIR/GATE_LIB.
# Real boot sets none of them, so every ":-" below resolves to the production
# value. The timings in particular exist because the real ones are measured
# against a printer that genuinely takes 15-25s to reconnect to its MCU, and
# a test suite cannot wait several minutes per scenario to learn that.

# exit in between avoids the race entirely; not modifying

# after detecting a bad update, by which point the old files no longer
# exist on disk at all.
#
# Detection uses release_info.json's own "version" field (written by
# Moonraker's net_deploy for a real update) rather than a git commit -
# falls back to a content hash of index.html for the offline factory seed,

# Real device found live (Phase 1.5 hardware qualification, 2026-08-19): the
# Scenario 6 crash reconcile_klipper_stack_on_boot() exists for was never
# generalized past the klipper_stack pair. A device's supervisor died
# mid-validate_component("klipper") on 2026-08-09 (back when klipper was
# still in the generic per-component loop, before the no-fork migration
# removed it), leaving updates/locks/klipper.lock + state=validating behind.
# Nothing ever reconciled it - poll_once's per-component loop treats
# state="validating" as "already in flight, skip" forever (there is no
# boot-time check equivalent to this one) - so it stayed stuck for 10 days
# and untold boots. Independently, S04nebulaos-migrate's own maintenance
# gate refuses to run migration on an already-seeded device with any lock
# present (by design - see that file's own header), and
# S05nebulaos-activate's validate_app() stays on the immutable copy for the
# same lock, on every boot. Nothing anywhere ever surfaced why.
#
# Generalizes the exact same fix: any component whose state file still says
# "validating" when a NEW supervisor process starts up did not survive its
# own transaction - nothing on disk it was validating has been proven - so
# it is safe to treat as interrupted and let normal delta detection
# re-validate from scratch, exactly like Scenario 6 already does for the
# pair. Covers moonraker and mainsail today, and any legacy single-component
# lock (like the klipper.lock above) a device may still be carrying from
# before the no-fork migration. $STACK_NAME is excluded - reconcile_klipper_
# stack_on_boot already owns it and runs separately (see loop() below).
#
# Phase 1.5 hardware closure (2026-08-19): iterates state.json files, NOT
# lock files - nebulaos-maintenance-gate.sh's own
# _maintenance_gate_reconcile_stale_locks() now runs earlier in boot
# (from S04, before this supervisor daemon even starts) and may have already
# removed the lock file for exactly this reason, to unblock S04/S05 on the
# same boot. If this function only looked for a lock file, a device the gate
# already cleared would have NO lock left for this loop to find, state.json
# would stay "validating" forever, and poll_once()'s own delta-detection
# would then treat that as "already in flight, skip" permanently - the exact
# same silent-forever-stuck failure this function exists to close, just
# moved to a different trigger. Keying off state.json instead makes this
# correct regardless of which one (this function, or the gate) runs first,

# restart_moonraker_service() is how Moonraker "restarts itself" for its

# Recover) - it calls do_service_action("restart", "moonraker") and
# swallows any exception (`except Exception: pass`, confirmed directly
# against vendor/moonraker's own source). moonraker.conf's [machine]
# section sets `provider: supervisord_cli`, but this Buildroot image has
# no supervisord daemon at all (no binary running, no config, nothing in
# any init.d script) - BusyBox init + this project's own S## scripts are
# used instead. `supervisorctl restart moonraker` therefore always fails,
# silently, and moonraker stays dead. The git-HEAD-delta detection below
# is this supervisor's only other restart trigger, and a Recover that
# fixes a dirty tree without moving HEAD (an entirely normal case) never
# produces a delta - live-reproduced exactly this way: Moonraker stayed
# dead for the rest of the boot with nothing left to notice. This is an
# independent liveness check with no git dependency at all, specifically
