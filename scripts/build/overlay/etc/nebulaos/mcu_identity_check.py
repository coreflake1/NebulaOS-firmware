"""MCU lifecycle check + restore entry point for S50nebulaos-mcu-guard.

Corrected in Phase 1.8B (offline pre-build review): the original version of
this file only ever performed a bootloader-level hardware-ID check
(creality_flash.identify()/check_identity()) and reported PASS whenever the
bootloader answered with the expected hardware ID - regardless of which
application firmware was actually running. That hardware ID has been
observed identical whether candidate-001 or stock Creality firmware is
installed, so it could never actually prove candidate-001 was running (see
mcu_lifecycle.py's module docstring for the exact evidence).

This entry point now delegates to mcu_lifecycle.decide() (which correctly
separates application identity from hardware identity) and, only when that
decision explicitly authorizes it, to mcu_restore.restore(). It never
performs any bootloader or flash interaction directly - all of that lives
in mcu_lifecycle.py/mcu_restore.py so it can be exercised by tests with
injected mocks instead of real hardware.

SAFETY CONTRACT (unchanged from the original file, still enforced):
  - No erase/write occurs anywhere except inside mcu_restore.restore(),
    and only when mcu_lifecycle.decide() returned RESTORE_AUTHORIZED.
  - Every bootloader interaction always calls app_start() before this
    process exits (enforced inside mcu_lifecycle._check_hardware_identity
    and mcu_restore.restore()'s use of creality_flash.flash(), which itself
    calls app_start() after a successful write).
  - Never writes to /dev/mmcblk0p1 or any block device - this file and its
    two collaborators only ever touch the MCU serial port and (in
    mcu_restore.py only) the MCU's own flash via the existing, separately
    hardware-identity-gated creality_flash.flash() function.
