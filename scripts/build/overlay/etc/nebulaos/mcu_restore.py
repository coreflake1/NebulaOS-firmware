"""MCU candidate restoration - the ONLY module in this lifecycle package
that erases/writes the MCU, and only when mcu_lifecycle.decide() has
already returned RESTORE_AUTHORIZED (exact known-stock application identity
- see mcu_lifecycle.py's module docstring for why the hardware-identity
check now happens in HERE, after bootloader entry, rather than before
authorization).

Artifact provenance (wired into the build as of the Phase 1.8B integration
candidate - scripts/build/overlay/opt/nebulaos/mcu-candidates/candidate-001.bin,
copied byte-for-byte from the already-validated NebulaOS-klipper-mcu build
output, SHA256-verified identical at overlay-copy time and re-verified at
build-verify time in 06-verify.sh):
  - Source of truth for the candidate binary and its hash: NebulaOS-klipper-mcu
    (build-time provenance in phase1.8-candidate-001.txt: MCU_REPO_COMMIT
    3aefd286..., built via that repo's GitHub Actions pipeline; the identical
    file also ships as candidate-001.provenance.json alongside the binary in
    this repo's overlay). This module does not build or fetch the artifact
    itself - it only validates and flashes whatever the OS image's build
    process already packaged.
  - On-device install path: /opt/nebulaos/mcu-candidates/<name>.bin plus a
    co-located provenance JSON - see 02-configure-buildroot.sh's overlay copy
    step, which places overlay/ verbatim into the built rootfs. The
    arm-none-eabi-readelf-dependent ELF/target validation
    (creality_validator.py's validate_target()) already ran once, in
    NebulaOS-klipper-mcu's own CI - that binutils dependency is exactly why
    stage4_first_flash.py needed --skip-validator on-device; doing that
    validation once at build time, not on every boot, is what removes the
    on-device toolchain dependency entirely.
  - Runtime validation split:
      BUILD TIME (already done, once, in NebulaOS-klipper-mcu's CI):
        - creality_validator.validate_format() / validate_target()
          (ELF section placement, .config sanity, GD32F303-specific checks)
        - exact hash computed and pinned into mcu_known_identities.py
      RUNTIME (this module, every restore attempt):
        - SHA256 verification of the on-device artifact against the pinned
          hash (cheap, no toolchain needed) - BEFORE any bootloader-entry
          attempt (see "two-stage authorization" below).
        - bootloader entry, then hardware identity allow-list check.
        - flash-result verification (creality_flash.flash_image()'s own
          status-byte checking)
        - post-flash APPLICATION identity verification (re-run the pre-Klippy
          identify handshake and confirm it now reports exactly
          NATIVE_CANDIDATE_001_VERSION - not just "flash reported success")

BOOTLOADER ENTRY (Phase 1.8B Option C, 2026-08-28): candidate-001's hardware
qualification found that creality_flash.py's serial magic-sequence bootloader
entry (enter_bootloader()) does not work against genuinely stock Creality
firmware - confirmed live (five attempts all returned baud-misaligned
garbage) and already documented in stage4_first_flash.py's own docstring
from Phase 1.7 ("the stock firmware's bootloader_request() lacks the 12KB
bootloader branch"). The proven-working alternative for this exact
transition is what stage4_first_flash.py used: trigger the same generic MCU
restart Klipper's own FIRMWARE_RESTART sends (mcu_restart.py, "reset" or
"config_reset", looked up from the MCU's real command dictionary - see that
module's docstring for the full upstream trace), then retry a bootloader
handshake. mcu_restart.py replicates that operation directly via
serialhdl/msgproto/reactor, without needing Klippy or Moonraker running -
compatible with this guard's pre-Klippy execution model, which
stage4_first_flash.py's Moonraker-dependent approach was not.

TWO-STAGE AUTHORIZATION:
  Stage 1 (software gate, in mcu_lifecycle.decide()): the running
    application's identity must be an EXACT match for a known-stock version
    - this alone authorizes calling restore(), before anything hardware-
    level is touched.
  Stage 2 (hardware gate, in THIS module, restore()): the candidate artifact
    must hash-match BEFORE any restart/bootloader-entry is attempted ("bad
    candidate hash -> no reset, no flash" - see _validate_candidate() below),
    and after bootloader entry, the live hardware ID must match the
    supported allow-list BEFORE any erase/write is attempted. Only when both
    stages pass does an actual flash happen.

SAFETY CONTRACT:
  - Never called except when mcu_lifecycle.decide() returned RESTORE_AUTHORIZED.
  - Refuses to proceed - no restart request, no bootloader entry attempt at
    all - on any candidate hash mismatch or missing artifact.
  - Only ever requests a restart via mcu_restart.py's real command-dictionary
    lookup ("reset"/"config_reset") - never an invented/hardcoded packet. If
    the MCU's dictionary exposes neither, or the resulting handshake never
    succeeds, this falls back once to creality_flash.py's existing magic-
    sequence enter_bootloader() before giving up - still exactly one bounded
    restore() call, still zero new protocol implementations.
  - Verifies live hardware ID against the allow-list AFTER bootloader entry
    and BEFORE any erase/write - a hardware mismatch here means FLASH_FAILED,
    never a flash attempt.
  - Bounded: exactly one flash attempt per restore() call, no internal retry
    loop, no infinite retry. The caller (the init.d service) may choose to
    retry on a subsequent boot, but this module never loops on its own.
