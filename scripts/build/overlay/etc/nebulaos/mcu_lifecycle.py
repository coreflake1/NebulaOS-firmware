"""MCU lifecycle state-machine orchestrator.

Corrects a conflation in the original Phase 1.8B guard design: that design's
PASS result meant only "the bootloader responded with hardware ID
mcu0_001_G32" - a HARDWARE presence check - and never actually consulted
which APPLICATION firmware is running. The bootloader hardware ID has been
observed identical whether candidate-001 or stock Creality firmware is
installed (compare the 2026-08-22 identity-query-result.txt, taken with
candidate-001 flashed, against the 2026-08-24 candidate-004 evidence, taken
moments after the stock slot had just auto-flashed stock firmware back on -
both report mcu0_001_G32), so a bootloader-only check can never distinguish
"candidate-001 is running" from "stock just clobbered the MCU."

This module separates the two identities explicitly:
  - APPLICATION identity: mcu_application_identify.py, a pre-Klippy read of
    Klipper's own IDENTIFY dictionary `version` field. Tells you which
    firmware is running. Does not require entering the bootloader.
  - HARDWARE identity: creality_flash.py's bootloader protocol. Tells you
    whether this is a supported physical KE MCU. Requires deliberately
    entering the bootloader (disrupts any live application connection),
    so it is only invoked when application identity alone can't produce a
    safe decision (known-stock, needing a restore-safety gate; or the
    application handshake itself failed).

Ordering rationale: application identify is tried FIRST and is non-invasive
(it's the same handshake Klipper does normally, on whatever mode the MCU is
already booted into). The bootloader check is only performed when actually
needed, so a healthy NATIVE_CANDIDATE_001 boot never has its running
connection disturbed by a bootloader-entry attempt it doesn't need.
