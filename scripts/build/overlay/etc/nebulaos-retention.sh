# NebulaOS mutable-runtime mission, Phase 9: namespace-restricted,
# update-aware retention manager. Informed by SimpleAF's real, currently-
# shipping tools/cleanup-files.sh (pellcorp/creality, fetched 2026-07-26 -
# full findings in docs/NEBULAOS_RETENTION_POLICY.md sec 1) but NOT a
# literal port: normal cleanup here is restricted to an explicit allowlist
# under /usr/data/nebulaos, adds a real active-print/partial-upload check
# before any emergency gcode deletion (a real gap in SimpleAF's own
# reference script - it has no such check at all), and never touches USB
# mounts.
#
# Invoked by /etc/init.d/S45nebulaos-cleanup at boot (backgrounded, does
# not block boot - matches SimpleAF's own S45cleanup convention). Can also
# be invoked manually with --dry-run to preview without deleting anything.

# Overridable for tests, same convention as S04nebulaos-migrate/flash-
# spare-slot.sh (Phase 2 final software closure mission, 2026-09-09 -
# needed the first time this script grew a real offline test suite).

# Phase 2 final software closure mission, 2026-09-09: migration-backups had

# reseed_git_app()'s own per-boot BACKUP_DIR="$BACKUP_ROOT/<timestamp>"
# full klipper+moonraker+nebulaos-klipper-extensions checkout backups
# (S04nebulaos-migrate) - up to several hundred MB each, one per migration
# run, forever. Extends this existing script rather than adding a second
# mechanism, per this project's own standing "one cleanup path" rule.
#
# Three distinct shapes under migration-backups/, all handled the same way
# (age +7 days, keep newest 2 - same KEEP as clean_obsolete_versions()'s
# failed-* retention above, for consistency):
#   1. Timestamp-named directories (BACKUP_ROOT/<ISO8601>/) - each one IS a
#      single backup event covering whichever of klipper/moonraker/
#      extensions were reseeded that run; pruned as one atomic unit by its
#      own name.
#   2. Named-category subdirectories (printer-cfg-migration/,
#      printer-cfg-migration-refused/, moonraker-conf-migration/,
#      moonraker-conf-migration-refused/, and any future migration adds) -
#      each one holds individual timestamped backup FILES; pruned
#      per-file, per-category, independently.
#   3. Loose files sitting directly at migration-backups/ root (e.g.
#      migrate_config_ownership()'s own printer.cfg.pre-config-ownership-
#      migration.<ts> - an existing minor inconsistency in where that one
#      migration writes its backup, not something this pass changes) -
#      pruned individually, as their own single-file "category".
#
# Never touches active config, printer.cfg, current SAVE_CONFIG, PLR
# state, MCU state, user macros, or anything else outside
# $NEBULAOS_ROOT/system/migration-backups itself - this function's only
# input is that one directory tree.
