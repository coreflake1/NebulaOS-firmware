#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The seed archives are produced by the build with each
# component's local branch forced to a specific name
# (scripts/build/lib/make-seed-archive.sh: `git checkout -q -B "$active_branch"`),
# and the on-device seeding functions then ASSERT that name before accepting
# the extracted checkout. For the extension set that name is
# $KLIPPER_EXTENSIONS_BRANCH - "production", the deployed-runtime branch -
# while the three on-device call sites hardcoded the literal "main", which is
# the DEVELOPMENT branch. The assertion compares branch NAMES, so commit
# equality between main and production never masked it: every seed was
# rejected, the extensions app directory was never created, no app generation
# was ever recorded, and every subsequent boot re-ran a full migration.
# (Audit finding F-06.)
#
# The fix is not to re-hardcode the currently-correct literal in three places.
# That is the same drift class, re-armed. The image already ships the
# authoritative answer as DATA: 04-cross-compile-app-stack.sh writes
# "branch": "$KLIPPER_EXTENSIONS_BRANCH" into the per-component object of
# seed-manifest.json, from the same variable that drives make_seed_archive, in
# the same build run, into the same immutable /opt/nebulaos-seeds directory as
# the archive itself. Manifest/archive drift is therefore structurally
# impossible, and the branch assertion keeps doing its real job: proving the
# extraction produced the archive that shipped, not proving which branch the
# build chose.
#
# The build's branch CHOICE is asserted separately and at the right layer, in
# source, by tests/extensions-updater-branch-strategy-tests.sh and
# tests/recovery-safety-tests.sh - not on a device after shipping.
#
# Extracted into a shared file rather than duplicated, for the same reason
# maintenance_gate_ok() was (see $GATE_LIB): the identical logic living in two
# places in these two scripts is exactly how a real bug ended up needing the
# identical fix twice.

# Print the "branch" value from one component object of a seed manifest.
#
# Deliberately BLOCK-SCOPED. A flat key grep (S04nebulaos-migrate's own
# json_get(), which takes `head -1`) would return the FIRST "branch" in the
# file - klipper's "master" - for every component asked about. That collision
# is the most likely way to get this wrong, so it is tested directly in
# tests/extensions-branch-contract-tests.sh.
#
# Usage: seed_manifest_branch <manifest-path> <component-name>
# Prints the branch on success; prints nothing and returns 1 on any failure.
