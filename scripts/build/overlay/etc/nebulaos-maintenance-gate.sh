# Shared maintenance-safety gate for S04nebulaos-factory-seed and
# S04nebulaos-migrate - both perform the exact same memory/IO-heavy work
# that must never run while a print is active, concurrently with a real
# update, or without memory-resilience swap active, and previously
# duplicated the identical gate logic independently in each script.
#
# Final Baseline Closure mission (2026-08-08): extracted into one shared
# file specifically because a real bug was found live in the duplicated
# logic - fixing it once here, rather than needing the identical fix
# applied twice (and risking the two copies drifting apart, exactly the
# failure class this project's own conventions exist to avoid - see
# scripts/build/lib/make-seed-archive.sh's own header for the same
# reasoning applied to a build-time shared function).
#
# Real bug found live during the Virgin Flash + Verification mission
# (2026-08-08): a stale update-transaction lock file, left over from
# BEFORE a persistent-state reset (an off-device backup + reset to
# simulate a virgin install), silently blocked every subsequent boot's
# factory-seed/migrate forever - neither script, nor anything else, ever
# cleared a stale lock, so the block was permanent until someone noticed
# and deleted it by hand.
#
# Fix is deliberately narrow. On a genuinely UNSEEDED namespace
# ($APPS/klipper/.git absent - i.e. seed_git_app has never once
# completed here), an update-transaction lock is PROVABLY irrelevant:
# this project's real update mechanism (/etc/nebulaos-update-
# supervisor.sh) only ever creates a lock while updating an app that has
# ALREADY been seeded - if the app has never been seeded at all, no real
# update could ever have legitimately created this lock, so it can only
# be leftover debris and is safe to clear automatically. On an
# ALREADY-seeded namespace, a lock is left exactly as blocking as
# before - that case can genuinely mean a real, recent, failed update
# that nebulaos-update-supervisor.sh's own comments document as
# deliberately needing human review before retrying ("a human must clear
# $LOCKDIR/$name.lock") - this fix must never bypass that case, and does
# not.
#
# Callers must already have their own log() function defined and their
# own $APPS/$LOCKDIR variables set before sourcing this file - this gate
# calls log() and reads those variables directly rather than taking them
# as parameters, so every existing log line keeps its own script's
# established "S04nebulaos-factory-seed: ..." / "S04nebulaos-migrate: ..."
# prefix unchanged.
#
# Phase 1.5 hardware closure (2026-08-19): a lock left behind by a
# supervisor process that died mid-validate_component()/mid-
# validate_klipper_stack() - state.json still says "validating", nothing on
# disk it was validating has ever been proven - blocked BOTH this gate
# (every boot, forever, via the ALREADY-seeded branch below) AND S05nebulaos-
# activate's own validate_app() lock check. nebulaos-update-supervisor.sh
# already has its own boot-time reconcile for exactly this
# (reconcile_klipper_stack_on_boot/reconcile_stale_component_locks_on_boot),
# but that is a separate, LATER-started daemon - this gate runs from S04,
# early in boot, and cannot wait for it. Clearing a lock whose own
# state.json says "validating" here, before the blocking check below ever
# runs, is what actually unblocks S04/S05 on the SAME boot the interruption
# is discovered, rather than only on the boot after next.
#
# Deliberately narrow, matching the same "never guess" discipline as the
# unseeded-namespace case below: only a lock whose sibling state file
# explicitly says "validating" is touched, and only the LOCK FILE is
# removed here - state.json itself is left exactly as it is (the supervisor
# reads state.json directly, not lock presence, so it still finds and fully
# repairs this state.json on its own next boot-time pass regardless of
# whether the lock file already disappeared). A malformed/missing/unreadable
# state file, or any other state (factory-fallback's own deliberate "a human
# must clear this" terminal state included), leaves the lock exactly as
# blocking as before - this must never bypass a real, recent, failed update.
