# Buildroot BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT for NebulaOS.
#
# Runs with $1 = TARGET_DIR, after TARGET_FINALIZE_HOOKS and after the rootfs
# overlay copy (Buildroot's own Makefile order: hooks, then overlays, then this
# script). That ordering is why the root password is fixed here rather than in
# the overlay or in BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_ROOT_PASSWD.
#
# WHY NOT BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_ROOT_PASSWD. Buildroot only treats that value as
# an already-hashed password when it matches $1$/$5$/$6$ - but .config is
# INCLUDED BY MAKE, which expands `$5` and friends as variables before that
# match ever runs. Measured: the hash
#
#     $5$NebulaOSrootsalt$loBE3...
#
# arrives at the match as `ebulaOSrootsaltoBE3...`, fails it, and falls through
# to mkpasswd, which salts randomly - rewriting /etc/shadow on every build.
# Doubling or backslash-escaping the dollars does not survive either, because
# $(call qstrip,...) expands the value a second time.
#
# WHY NOT THE OVERLAY. /etc/shadow is mode 0600 in the image. Git records only
# 0644 or 0755, so shipping it through the overlay would publish a
# world-readable shadow file. That is a worse defect than the one being fixed.
#
# So: edit the line in place, here, preserving the file's existing mode and
# every other account. Same password as before - only the salt stops being
# random.
