# NebulaOS auto-updates-camera-complete mission (2026-07-28, see
# docs/NEBULAOS_MOONRAKER_UPDATE_AND_CAMERA_ANALYSIS.md). Shared by
# scripts/build/04-cross-compile-app-stack.sh (real build - packages
# vendor/klipper and vendor/moonraker) and tests/factory-seed-git-tests.sh
# (offline fixture repos) - kept in its own file specifically so the tests
# exercise this exact function, not a second/parallel reimplementation of
# its validation rules.
#
# PRIOR APPROACH (removed): each vendor checkout was flattened into a
# single synthetic orphan commit ("NebulaOS factory seed snapshot of
# <branch> @ <true_commit>") before bundling, because a plain
# `git bundle create` of vendor/klipper's shallow clone (1-2 commits deep,
# 00-fetch-vendor-sources.sh's clone_pinned) produces a bundle that
# `git bundle verify` reports as fine but a real `git clone` of rejects
# with "Failed to traverse parents of commit ..." / "remote did not send
# all necessary objects" (confirmed again against git 2.55.0 - a genuine,
# still-present git limitation, not a syntax mistake). That synthetic
# commit had no shared ancestry with the real coreflake1/NebulaOS-klipper
# or Arksine/moonraker history on GitHub, which made Moonraker's own
# `git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/<branch>` check permanently
# fail (return code 1) on every freshly-seeded device - HEAD could never
# be an ancestor of a real remote branch it shared no history with. This
# set `diverged=true` -> `has_recoverable_errors()=true` ->
# `is_valid()=false` (vendor/moonraker/moonraker/components/update_manager/
# git_deploy.py) permanently, blocking every real Klipper/Moonraker update.
#
# FIX: stop bundling/flattening entirely. Archive each vendor checkout's
# REAL `.git` directory (shallow boundary, real branch, real commits) plus
# its working tree as a plain tar file, with the local branch renamed to
# match Moonraker's hardcoded reserved-slot expectation ("master" - see
# BASE_CONFIG in update_manager/common.py, not configurable) and origin
# rewritten to the real public remote. On-device seeding (S04) then
# extracts the tar directly into place - no `git clone` at all, which is
# also strictly cheaper on this 208MB device than the clone-from-bundle
# step it replaces (plain tar extraction does no object repacking).

# chelper_enforce_mtime() lives in the same overlay file the device itself
# uses at boot (/etc/nebulaos-chelper-preflight.sh), sourced here rather than
# reimplemented, so the build-time and boot-time definitions of the invariant
# cannot drift apart - the same reasoning that put make_seed_archive() itself
# in a shared file rather than duplicating it between the build and its tests.
# Only sourced if not already defined, so a caller that has already sourced it
# (04-cross-compile-app-stack.sh does) is unaffected.
