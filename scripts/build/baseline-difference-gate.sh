#!/bin/sh
# Phase 5 baseline-difference gate. Compares the just-built package against
# the pinned qualified baseline package and hard-stops on any unexplained
# difference. Allowed differences are exactly: the guppyscreen binary/hash
# (NOT guppybeep - see the Allowed differences section below), z_compensate.py,
# explicit build/version metadata, and associated tests/manifests.
#
# Scope of what is actually GATED, stated plainly because the wording used to
# overstate it: the pass/fail signal in this script is the tracked
# config/DTS comparison. The "Allowed differences" section is prose echoed into
# baseline-difference.txt for a human reader - it documents expectations, it
# does not enforce them.
#
# Requires unsquashfs (squashfs-tools) on the host to compare rootfs
# contents; falls back to a kernel.config/DTS-only comparison with a loud
# warning if unavailable.
#
# Usage: sh scripts/build/baseline-difference-gate.sh
# Run AFTER 05-final-build.sh.

# 2026-08-07: reference by TAG NAME, not a hardcoded SHA - see
# assert-baseline-config.sh's own comment on why (the 2026-08-07
# canonical-repository mission's history rewrite, git filter-repo,
# changes the commit hash a tag points to; the tag NAME survives that
# unchanged). The previous hardcoded f9dc10f594c... stopped resolving to
# any object at all after the rewrite.
#
# 2026-08-14 (Phase 11 verification-gate fix): a hardcoded tag NAME goes
# stale just as surely as a hardcoded SHA - see assert-baseline-config.sh's
# matching fix and comment for the full incident writeup (a real Phase 9
# fresh-build run hit this exact staleness: FAIL against a baseline that
# was never wrong, just 11 days and 5 accepted baselines out of date).
# Derived the reference from the most recently created
# nebulaos-canonical-baseline-* tag instead of a fixed name.
#
# Final Closure mission, Phase B (2026-08-15): "newest tag wins" is still
# implicit - a new tag silently becomes the reference the moment it's
# pushed. One explicit value instead: QUALIFIED_BASELINE_TAG in
# manifests/dependencies.conf - see assert-baseline-config.sh's matching
# fix and comment for the full reasoning.
