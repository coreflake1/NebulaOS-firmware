"""Package the canonical NebulaOS core into a Creality F005 OTA .img.

WHAT A KE .img ACTUALLY IS

Not a raw disk image. It is the OTA package the stock Creality updater consumes,
delivered over USB or the touchscreen, or from the CLI:

    /etc/ota_bin/local_ota_update.sh /path/to/NebulaOS-....img

The .img extension is checked by the stock updater, which is why the output must
carry it; it says nothing about the contents. Inside is an encrypted 7z archive
holding a versioned directory of metadata and chunked payloads.

An earlier revision of this file produced a raw GPT disk image. That was simply
the wrong format - it would not have been accepted by the updater at all, and
writing it to a device would have destroyed the stock slot, the persistent data
partitions and the per-unit sn_mac identity. This replaces it entirely.

WHERE IT INSTALLS, AND WHAT THAT MEANS

The stock updater writes whichever A/B set is INACTIVE and then flips the ota
marker to point at what it just wrote:

    booted A (ota:kernel)   ->  writes kernel2 + rootfs2, sets ota:kernel2
    booted B (ota:kernel2)  ->  writes kernel  + rootfs,  sets ota:kernel

So the destination is not a property of this package - it is a property of which
slot the printer is running when the package is applied. A NebulaOS .img applied
while NebulaOS is booted will overwrite the STOCK slot. There is no
vendor-signature check and no comparison of the target's existing contents
against a Creality release that would prevent that.

That is worth stating precisely. It does NOT mean "there are no checks": the
updater validates package extraction, version, metadata, partition capacity,
per-chunk MD5 and declared full sizes, and this packager exists to satisfy every
one of them. It means there is no AUTHENTICITY check tying a partition to
Creality's own bytes. A structurally valid custom package is writable, which is
exactly why custom F005 firmware can be installed through the stock update path.

THE CHAINED-MD5 CHUNK SCHEME

Each payload is split into 1 MiB chunks whose filenames form a chain:

    <name>.0000.<md5 of the WHOLE payload>
    <name>.0001.<md5 of chunk 0000>
    <name>.0002.<md5 of chunk 0001>
    ...

so each chunk's name carries the digest of its PREDECESSOR, and only the first
carries the digest of the complete image. Alongside them:

    ota_md5_<name>.<md5 of the whole payload>

whose lines are the per-chunk digests in order. The updater verifies that list
before streaming anything into the MMC partition, so getting the chain wrong
produces a package that is rejected rather than one that half-installs.

THE ARCHIVE PASSWORD

Derived, not hardcoded:

    mkpasswd -m md5 "F005C3_7e_bz" -S cxswfile

computed here through the same MD5-crypt algorithm and then asserted against the
known-good result, so a wrong algorithm is caught at build time rather than by a
printer refusing to open the package.

VERIFICATION IS A HARD GATE

build() does not return success because 7z exited 0. scripts/package/
validate-img.py re-opens the archive, reassembles both payloads from the
packaged chunks, and requires

    SHA256(reassembled) == SHA256(canonical)

for xImage and rootfs.squashfs both. Anything less would let a chunking bug ship.
